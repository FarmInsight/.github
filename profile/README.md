### What is FarmInsight you ask?
FarmInsight is a platform that leverages data analysis to track crop yields, weather patterns, and market prices to provide farmers with valuable 
insights for crop planning and help them make more informed decisions. 
Our platform provides predictive analytics to farmers, helping them decide which crops to grow based on weather forecasts and estimates the
market prices. <br>

The FarmInsight platform consists of several repositories, each with a specific purpose:

## Data Analysis
The `data-analysis` repository contains all the code for data analysis, including data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. 

## Web App
The `FarmInsight-web-app` repository contains the code for our web application. The web app provides an intuitive interface for farmers to access 
the data analysis results, including crop recommendations and market price predictions.

## Mobile App 
The `FarmInsight-mobile-app` repository contains the code for our mobile application. The mobile app provides on-the-go access to the data analysis results 
and allows farmers to receive push notifications for critical updates.

## API
The `FarmInsight-API` repository contains the code for our API, which serves data analysis results to both the web app and the mobile app and
allows external developers to access our data analysis results.
